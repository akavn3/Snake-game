I. Functional Requirements (What the game does):

Game Area: A defined rectangular area (400x400 pixels for this example) where the game is played, displayed on an HTML canvas element.
Snake Representation: The snake is represented by a series of connected rectangles (initially one).
Snake Movement: The snake moves continuously in a chosen direction (up, down, left, right).
Snake Control: The player controls the snake's direction using keyboard input (arrow keys or WASD).
Snake Growth: When the snake "eats" food, it grows by one segment.
Food Generation: Food is generated randomly within the game area as small rectangles.
Collision Detection:
Self-Collision: The game ends if the snake's head collides with its own body.
Wall Collision: The game ends if the snake's head collides with the boundaries of the game area.
Scoring: The game keeps track of the player's score (number of food items eaten), displayed in a designated area.
Game Over: The game ends upon collision, potentially displaying a "Game Over" message and the final score.
Game Start/Restart: The player can start a new game or restart after a game over.
II. Non-Functional Requirements (How the game performs):

Responsiveness: The game should be playable on various screen sizes (within reason; we won't aim for perfect responsiveness in this initial implementation, but we'll consider basic scaling).
Smooth Gameplay: The snake's movement should be smooth and consistent, without noticeable lag.
Performance: The game should run efficiently in modern web browsers (using client-side JavaScript).
User Interface (UI): A clean and simple UI, including a clear score display.
Cross-Browser Compatibility: The game should function correctly in major modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
Mobile Compatibility: The game should be playable on mobile browsers (though touch controls are beyond the scope of this initial version).
III. Technical Requirements:

Programming Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (client-side).
HTML Structure:
<!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <body> structure.
<canvas id="gameCanvas" width="400" height="400"></canvas> for the game area.
<div id="score">Score: 0</div> for the score display.
Linking to an external JavaScript file (<script src="script.js"></script>).
CSS Styling: Basic styling for the canvas (e.g., a border).
JavaScript Logic:
Handling game state (snake position, direction, food position, score).
Drawing on the canvas using the Canvas API.
Handling user input (keyboard events).
Implementing game logic (movement, collision detection, game over).
IV. Visual Requirements:

Snake Color: Green (or any color of your choice).
Food Color: Red (or a contrasting color).
Background Color (Canvas): White (or a suitable background).
Canvas Border: Black (or a contrasting color).
This comprehensive list should give us a solid foundation. Let's proceed with the first prompt:

"Generate the basic HTML structure for a web page containing a canvas element for the snake game. The canvas should have an ID of gameCanvas, a width of 400 pixels, a height of 400 pixels, and a black border. Also, include a div element with the ID score to display the player's score. Link an external JavaScript file named script.js."
